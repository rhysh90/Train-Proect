-- Dda06defs v1.0
-- This Package contains the definitions of register addresses
-- and bit assignments for the 4 DACs of the CIO-DDA06/Jr
-- card connected to the CAB board.

-- Also contains unchecked_conversion functions to convert register
-- records to Unsigned_8 which is needed when calling Write_IO_Port
-- in Io_Ports package.

-- Author : Rob Allen
-- version 0.0 7-Jul-07 derived Simdda06 from Pc14defs,Dio48def v2.0.1
--    same type for all bytes, convenience arrays of addresses
-- version 1.0 25-Feb-08 renamed Dda06defs
-- version 1.1  3-Apr-08 changed index type for Daxx_Addr
--
with Unchecked_Conversion; -- used for type conversions
with Unsigned_Types;  -- defines Unsigned_8 needed for 
   -- compatiblity with Marte
with Raildefs;  -- for Dac_Id
